🚗 Parking Demand & Dynamic Pricing Model


📌 Project Overview

This project implements a full end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to model parking demand and predict dynamic parking prices based on real-world factors such as occupancy, queue length, traffic conditions, time patterns, vehicle type, and special days.

The system combines:

    Explainable rule-based demand pricing (baseline)

    Advanced ML regression models for accurate price prediction

    Strict data leakage prevention and time-based evaluation

🎯 Objective (Target Data Mining Task)

    To predict parking price (continuous value) at a given time and location using historical parking and contextual data.

    Why this matters:
        Helps optimize parking revenue

        Reduces congestion during peak hours

        Enables fair and demand-aware pricing

        Supports smart-city transportation planning

🧠 Key Outcomes

    Built a robust ML pipeline covering the complete data science lifecycle

    Achieved high predictive accuracy using Gradient Boosting and Random Forest

    Ensured realistic evaluation using time-based train/validation/test splits

    Prevented target leakage by separating demand-construction logic from ML features

    Enabled manual prediction testing (interactive, CSV, and programmatic inputs)

Sample Test Performance (after leakage fixes):
    Model	RMSE	MAE	R²
    Gradient Boosting	~0.03–0.04	~0.02	~0.99
    Random Forest	~0.04–0.05	~0.03	~0.99
